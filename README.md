# PHSX815_Week8
contains the homework/practice code and other materials for week 8 


This code is made entirely using code from my own respositories as well as the repositories of professor Rogan
https://github.com/crogan/PHSX815_Week8

To run homework 8:
First put the Random.py file in a folder, which you need to specifiy in the Neyman.py code.
Next, to run the Neyman.py code, simply run python3 Neyman.py -sigx 10 -Nexp 10000 -Nmeas 10 (for example).
This should generate a 2D histogram depicting the measured values of mu for the lognorm vs the actual values of mu (an example graph is provided in this repository).
